Personal zsh configuration, built from the ground up, using bits and
pieces from around the web, as well as lots of personal baggage gathered
from various shell configs over the years. A work in progress and
nothing super fancy.

So far, the primary sources for the config have been Oh My Zsh (which
I used for some time), this repo:
https://github.com/spicycode/ze-best-zsh-config and misc blog posts.
